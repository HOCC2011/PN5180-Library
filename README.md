# PN5180 Library (HOCC)
Based on https://github.com/ATrappmann/PN5180-Library.

# What works (tested):
ISO 14443-3 anticollision and select\
ISO 14443-4 RATS and sending/receiving apdu commands

# To-do:
Allow the code to use other pins as the spi connection by requiring passing the spi object to the library instead of starting the default spi interface.
